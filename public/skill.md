## How the Game Works

### Round Lifecycle

```
GameStarted → 60s timer (block.timestamp) → reset() → Chainlink VRF → RoundSettled → next GameStarted
```

1. A round starts. You have ~60 seconds to deploy.
2. Call `deploy(blockIds)` with ETH - it's split equally across your chosen blocks.
3. After the timer expires, `reset()` is called (automated by the backend).
4. Chainlink VRF returns 3 random words:
   - **Word 0**: Winning block (`% 25`, uniform random - no block has better odds)
   - **Word 1**: Split/single BEAN winner (`% 2`) + weighted random seed
   - **Word 2**: Beanpot trigger (`% 777`)
5. Round settles. Winners are all miners who deployed to the winning block.
6. Next round starts immediately.

**Empty rounds** (zero deployments): settle instantly, no VRF, no BEAN minted, no beanpot growth.

**No-winner rounds** (deployments exist but nobody deployed to the winning block): all ETH goes to admin fee + treasury vault. No BEAN minted. Beanpot does NOT grow.

### ETH Rewards

Fees are deducted, then the remaining pool is split proportionally among winning-block miners.

```
adminFee      = totalDeployed × 1%                              (from everyone)
losersPool    = totalDeployed − winnersDeployed
vaultAmount   = (losersPool − losersPool × 1%) × 10%            (from losers only)
claimablePool = totalDeployed − adminFee − vaultAmount

yourReward = claimablePool × (yourDeployOnWinningBlock / totalOnWinningBlock)
```

**Key insight**: The vault fee only applies to losers' ETH. If the winning block holds a large share of the total pool, the effective house edge is lower. Conversely, if you're the only miner and you win, you get back almost everything minus ~1% admin.

### BEAN Rewards (1 BEAN per round)

Two possible distribution modes (50/50 chance):

- **Split**: 1 BEAN divided proportionally among all winners based on ETH deployed to the winning block.
- **Single winner**: One miner wins all 1 BEAN via weighted random - more ETH on the winning block = higher probability. If >2000 unique miners deployed in the entire round (not just the winning block), forced to split as a safety cap.

### Beanpot (Jackpot)

- **Accumulates** 0.1 BEAN per round (only when the winning block has miners).
- **Trigger**: `VRF_word_2 % 777 == 0` (~0.13% per eligible round). Must have existing pool > 0.
- **Payout**: Entire accumulated pool split proportionally among winning-block miners. Pool resets. This round's 0.1 BEAN starts a fresh pool.
- **No hit**: 0.1 BEAN added to existing pool. Pool grows over time.
- Beanpot value visible via API (`beanpotPool` field) and on-chain (`GridMining.beanpotPool()`).

### Roasting Fee (BEAN Claims)

When you claim BEAN:
- **10% fee on mined (unroasted) BEAN only**. Roasted bonus is NOT taxed.
- Fee is redistributed to all users with unclaimed BEAN as a "roasting bonus."
- Holding unclaimed BEAN earns you passive income from others' claim fees.
- If you're the last unclaimed holder, the fee is burned instead.

**Checkpoint**: Rewards are auto-checkpointed when you `deploy()`, `claimETH()`, or `claimBEAN()`. No manual checkpoint needed.

### Fee Flow Summary

```
Total ETH in round
├── 1% admin fee (from total)     → Fee Collector
├── ~10% vault fee (from losers)  → Treasury
│   └── Buyback: ETH → BEAN (90% burned, 10% to stakers as yield)
└── Remainder (claimablePool)     → Winners (proportional)

BEAN minted: 1.0 → winners   |   0.1 → beanpot pool
Beanpot: 1/777 chance to pay entire accumulated pool to winners

BEAN claims: 10% fee on mined BEAN → roasting bonus for unclaimed holders
             Roasted BEAN: untaxed
```

## Strategy

### Expected Value (EV)

Each round has a negative ETH EV due to fees, but positive total EV when BEAN rewards are valuable enough.

```
ETH house edge ≈ 1% admin + ~10% vault (from losers only)
BEAN value     = 1 BEAN × priceNative (from /api/price)
Beanpot EV     = (1/777) × beanpotPool × priceNative

Net EV per round ≈ BEAN_value + Beanpot_EV − (ETH_deployed × effective_house_edge)
```

Use `/api/price` for `priceNative` (BEAN price in ETH) and `/api/round/current` for `beanpotPool`.

**When to play**: EV is positive when `BEAN_value + Beanpot_EV > ETH_deployed × ~0.11`. Higher BEAN price and larger beanpot make every round more profitable.

### Block Selection

All 25 blocks have **equal 1/25 win probability** (Chainlink VRF is uniform random). Strategy is about share, not odds:

- **Fewer blocks** (1–3): Higher risk, higher reward per block if you win. Best when pool is large relative to your bet.
- **More blocks** (10–25): Higher win rate, smaller reward per win. Consistent but lower upside.
- **Read the grid**: Watch SSE `deployed` events. Deploy to **less crowded blocks** for a bigger proportional share if the VRF picks your block.
- **Empty blocks**: If you're the only miner on a block and it wins, you get the entire claimablePool share for that block.

### Timing

Rounds are 60 seconds (based on `block.timestamp`, which may drift ~2s from wall clock on Base).

- **Deploy early**: Others see your position via SSE and may counter.
- **Deploy late**: Less time for others to react, but risk missing the round if your tx doesn't confirm in time.
- **Reactive**: Watch SSE for 40–50 seconds, then deploy to the least crowded blocks.

### Bet Sizing

- **Minimum**: `0.0000025 ETH × numBlocks`
- **Bankroll**: Don't risk more than a small percentage per round. BEAN's variance is high (1/25 win probability per block).
- **Pool context**: Check `totalDeployed` on `/api/round/current`. Your share of the winning block determines reward size.

### BEAN Management

1. **Hold unclaimed BEAN**: Earn passive roasting bonus (10% of every other user's BEAN claim fees redistribute to you).
2. **Stake BEAN**: Earn yield from treasury buybacks. Check APR via `/api/staking/stats` (value is already a percentage, e.g. `"7.52"` = 7.52%).
3. **Self-compound**: Call `compound()` - no fee, no cooldown.
4. **Track price**: Use `/api/price` for BEAN/ETH rate. Sell when price is high, accumulate when low.

### AutoMiner vs Manual

| | Manual | AutoMiner |
|---|---|---|
| Control | Full (choose blocks, amount, timing each round) | Strategy preset (random/all/select) |
| Cost | Gas per deploy (~$0.001 on Base) | Executor fee: max(flatFee, %) per round + upfront deposit |
| Upside | React to grid state in real-time | Hands-off, runs N rounds automatically |
| Best for | Active play, reactive strategy | Passive play, guaranteed participation |

## Agent Workflow

```
1. INITIALISE
   GET /api/stats                       → global stats, BEAN price
   GET /api/price                       → detailed price data (priceNative for EV calc)
   GET /api/round/current?user=ADDR     → current grid + beanpot + your position
   GET /api/user/ADDR/rewards           → pending ETH + BEAN rewards
   GET /api/staking/ADDR                → staking position
   Connect SSE: /api/events/rounds      → real-time updates

2. EACH ROUND (~60 seconds)
   a. Observe: SSE 'deployed' events show real-time grid state
   b. Analyse: Calculate EV (BEAN price × 1 + beanpot EV − fees)
   c. Evaluate: Which blocks are least crowded? What's your bankroll?
   d. Decide: Choose blocks + ETH amount (or skip this round)
   e. Execute: GridMining.deploy(blockIds) with ETH
   f. Wait: SSE 'roundTransition' event → see if you won

3. CLAIM REWARDS (periodically, when gas-efficient)
   - Check /api/user/ADDR/rewards
   - claimETH() when pendingETH is meaningful
   - claimBEAN() - consider holding for roasting bonus vs claiming
   - Consider BEAN price trend before claiming (holding = roasting bonus)

4. MANAGE BEAN
   - If staking APR is attractive: approve() → deposit()
   - Compound yield regularly: compound()
   - Track performance: /api/user/ADDR/history?type=deploy (PNL per round)
   - Rebalance: withdraw stake if better opportunities arise

5. RECONNECT
   - On SSE drop: GET /api/round/current + reconnect SSE
```

---

## Critical Rules

1. **One deploy per round** - second attempt reverts `AlreadyDeployedThisRound`.
2. **Minimum deploy**: 0.0000025 ETH per block. Transaction reverts below this.
3. **Approve before staking**: Call `Bean.approve(stakingAddress, amount)` before `Staking.deposit()`.
4. **Roasting fee**: 10% on mined BEAN only. Roasted bonus (from others' fees) is untaxed.
5. **Block timestamps**: Round timing uses `block.timestamp`, not wall clock. Base ~2s block times cause minor drift.
6. **Beanpot conditions**: Only accumulates AND can trigger when winning block has at least 1 miner.
7. **Empty rounds**: Zero deployments = instant settle, no VRF, no BEAN, no beanpot growth.
8. **Checkpoint auto-trigger**: `deploy()`, `claimETH()`, `claimBEAN()` all checkpoint your previous round automatically.
9. **AutoMiner fees**: Hybrid `max(flatFee, percentageFee)` per round, frozen at config creation. Check via `/api/automine/ADDR`.
10. **Rate limits**: API has default 60 req/min, strict 5 req/min on RPC-heavy endpoints (user balances, rewards, staking).
